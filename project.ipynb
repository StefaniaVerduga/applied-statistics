    "**1.1. Description of the Project**\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to analyze the PlantGrowth R dataset[01]. The PlantGrowth data are the results from an experiment to compare yields (as measured by dried weight of plants) obtained under a control and two different treatment conditions. This dataset contains two main variables, a treatment group and the weight of plants within those groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to analze this dataset, I will follow the following steps:\n",
    "1. Download and save the dataset to the repository.\n",
    "2. Describe the data set in the notebook.\n",
    "3. Describe what a t-test is, how it works, and what the assumptions are.\n",
    "4. Perform a t-test to determine whether there is a significant difference between the two treatment groups `trt1` and `trt2`.\n",
    "5. Perform ANOVA to determine whether there is a significant difference between the three treatment groups `ctrl`, `trt1` and `trt2`.\n",
    "6. Explain why it is more appropriate to apply ANOVA rather than several t-tests when analyzing more than two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2. Objectives of the Project**\n",
    "The aim of this project is to carry out a statistical analysis using the t-Stadistic and ANOVA to determine the degree of effect on plant growth of the control treatment or two different treatments conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The database consists of 30 cases on 2 variables `weight` and `group`.\n",
    "The levels of group are `ctrl`, `trt1` and `trt2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.3. Technology and Libraries used for this project**\n",
    "This project was developed using Python [02] and the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pandas**: Used to perform data manipulation and analysis. Pandas is a Python library for data analysis. It is built on top of two core Python librariesâ€”matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for mathematical operations. Pandas acts as a wrapper over these libraries, allowing you to access many of matplotlib's and NumPy's methods with less code. [03]\n",
    "- **Numpy**: Used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation. [04]\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization and graphical ploting. Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. [05]\n",
    "- **Seaborn**: Built on top of matplotlib with similar functionalities. Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. [06]\n",
    "- **Scipy**: Is an open-source Python library which is used to solve scientific and mathematical problems. SciPy provides algorithms for optimization, integration, algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics and many other classes of problems. [07]\n",
