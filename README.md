# Applied Statistics

Course: HDip in Computer in Data Analytics  
Module: Applied Statistics 
Author: Stefania Verduga  

The `applied-statistics` repository contains the solutions of different tasks and the final project within the Applied Statistics module.

## Table of Contents.

### Tasks

Within the "tasks.ipynb" we can find the different solved tasks:
1. Task 1: Permutations and Combinations
2. Task 2: numpy's Normal Distribution
3. Task 3: t-Test Calculation
4. Task 4: ANOVA

### Project

The `project.ipynb` repository contains the PlantGrowth R dataset analysis in which I will develop the statistical tests learnt during this module, as t-test and ANOVA.

## Instructions to clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook.

### Cloning the repository

This project was carried out with a Mac computer, so below I will explain the steps carried out on this computer to clone the repository.

1. The first step is to have Git installed on your computer.
2. Once we have Git installed, we need to open Terminal through the Applications --> Utilities folder.
3. We should navigate to the directory where we want to clone the repository using the command "cd".
4. The next step is to clone the repository using the 'git clone' command followed by the URL of the repository we want to clone, in this case:
```python
git clone https://github.com/StefaniaVerduga/applied-statistics.git
```
This command will create a new directory with the same name as the repository in our current location and copy the repository files into it.

### Running Jupyter Notebook  

Next, I am going to explain how I created and carried out this project in Jupyter Notebook through VSCode.

1. The first step is to install Visual Studio Code and all the needed extensions: Python and Jupyter extensions.
2. Open the folder or workshop where we want to create or open Jupyter Notebooks, in this case the folder where we have our repository. We should create a new Jupyter Notebook by clicking on the "Create a new file" button and saving it with a `.ipynb` extension.
3. Then, we should select a Kernel and choose the Python interpreter that we want to use for running the notebook.
4. Once all the previous steps are already done, we can run code cells by clicking the "Run Cell" button on the left side of each code cell or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter.
