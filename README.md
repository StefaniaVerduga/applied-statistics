## Instructions to clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook.

### Cloning the repository

This project was carried out with a Mac computer, so below I will explain the steps carried out on this computer to clone the repository.

1. The first step is to have Git installed on your computer.
2. Once we have Git installed, we need to open Terminal through the Applications --> Utilities folder.
3. We should navigate to the directory where we want to clone the repository using the command "cd".
4. The next step is to clone the repository using the 'git clone' command followed by the URL of the repository we want to clone, in this case:
```python
git clone https://github.com/StefaniaVerduga/applied-statistics.git
```
This command will create a new directory with the same name as the repository in our current location and copy the repository files into it.
