    "The purpose of this project is to analyze the PlantGrowth R dataset. This dataset contains two main variables, a treatment group and the weight of plants within those groups. The main goal is to perform t-tests and ANOVA on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve this goal, I will follow the following steps:\n",
    "1. Download and save the dataset to the repository.\n",
    "2. Describe the data set in the notebook.\n",
    "3. Describe what a t-test is, how it works, and what the assumptions are.\n",
    "4. Perform a t-test to determine whether there is a significant difference between the two treatment groups `trt1` and `trt2`.\n",
    "5. Perform ANOVA to determine whether there is a significant difference between the three treatment groups `ctrl`, `trt1` and `trt2`.\n",
    "6. Explain why it is more appropriate to apply ANOVA rather than several t-tests when analyzing more than two groups."
